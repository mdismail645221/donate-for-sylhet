                <h1>Deterioration of flood situation in Sylhet, longing for relief</h1>
                <p>The overall flood situation in Sylhet has further deteriorated. The water of Surma and Kushiyara rivers has been flowing over the danger zone for eight days. Thousands of villages in 13 upazilas of the district, including Sylhet city, are still facing water shortage. As a result, many have become unemployed, on the other hand, the food stored in the house has run out. Many have also complained that flood-affected people are not getting adequate relief.</p>
                <p>Due to heavy rains on Wednesday night, the water level in the rivers has increased a little and new areas have been flooded since Thursday morning. According to various sources including local administration and people's representatives, at least 10 to 12 lakh people are stranded in Sylhet. Banavasi people complain that there is still water in many houses. Many have left their homes and taken refuge safely. Some people are building a loft inside the house.</p>
